<h1>Nataly</h1>
<div class="myDiv">
<p>My name is Nataly and I have studied mostly front-end-stuff, like HTML+CSS+JavaScript, React, WordPress and SQL as well. 
 At this moment I am working in a totally different field in early childhood education and I have forgotten a lot of my studied materials - so I need to remind it back to me and practise a lot more. I am very interested in working it-field and study more to become some sort of software developer.
I have also Health Care background in Stadin aikuisopisto learning Customer Service and Information Management (practicing in health centers).
Customer service, information systems, using data and digital marketing are my interests at he moment.
At my "work-free-time" I do enjoy listening music, playing piano, walking in the nature, and practising yoga :)
